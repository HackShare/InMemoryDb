InMemoryDb
==========

Some helper classes to use Android database with storage on disk and in memory (optional).

You may be interrested in [this project](https://github.com/robUx4/android-contentprovider-generator) that can generate all the 
data source code based on a JSON definition of the database fields. It can even generate a Content Provider for you.
